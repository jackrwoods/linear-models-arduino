# linear-models-arduino

For a capstone project, my team needed to know how fast we could evaluate a linear model on a small microprocessor. I chose to write this small library to *potentially* make my effort more useful at a later stage in this project. This library allows you to **evaluate** multivariate linear models on an Arduino.

This project is posted with the MIT license, so feel free to use this code and make derivatives as you wish. I do not plan to maintain the project over the long term.
